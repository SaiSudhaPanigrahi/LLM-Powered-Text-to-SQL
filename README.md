# Converting Natural Language Query to SQL Statments

What if we could talk to a database? This would allow non-technical people to become SQL programmers and extract whatever insights they want. 

This project presents a schema-aware Text-to-SQL (T2S) system that translates natural language questions into executable SQL queries. The system is architected as a robust FastAPI service that leverages multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for high accuracy and is optimized for efficient, cost-effective local inference.

The core methodology achieves **81% execution accuracy** on the complex, multi-table **Spider** benchmark. This work bridges the gap between theoretical research and practical deployment by creating a system that is not only accurate but also scalable and user-friendly.

## üåü Key Features

* **High-Accuracy SQL Generation**: Utilizes a fine-tuned **SQLCoder-7B** model, building on foundational research with T5 and BART models, to generate syntactically and semantically correct SQL.
* **Dynamic Semantic Schema Matching**: Employs **Sentence-BERT (SBERT)** to intelligently match a user's question to the most relevant database schema from over 35 candidates, achieving **over 90% accuracy** in schema selection.
* **Multi-Layer Validation Pipeline**: Ensures query reliability through a comprehensive validation process, including initial syntax checks (`sqlparse`), schema compliance, and a final execution check against a **SQLite** engine to verify correctness.
* **Optimized for Local Inference**: Uses **GGUF quantization** to run the powerful 7B parameter model efficiently on local hardware, drastically reducing operational costs compared to API-based solutions.
* **Production-Grade API**: Built with **FastAPI**, the system exposes clean, RESTful endpoints for schema matching, SQL generation, and query execution, with robust error handling and logging.
* **Proven on Complex Benchmarks**: The system's effectiveness was validated on the **WikiSQL** and **Spider** datasets, demonstrating its ability to handle both simple and complex multi-table database structures.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system employs a modular pipeline that processes a natural language question through several stages to ensure the final SQL query is accurate, relevant, and executable.

1. **Semantic Schema Matching**: The user's question is first encoded into a dense vector embedding using **Sentence-BERT (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)**. This embedding is compared against pre-computed embeddings of all available database schemas using cosine similarity to find the most relevant one.
2. **Schema-Aware Prompt Engineering**: The identified schema is formatted using custom **XML-like tags (`<tab>`, `<col>`)** and concatenated with the original question. This technique provides critical structural context to the LLM, reducing errors and hallucinations.
3. **LLM-Based SQL Generation**: The structured prompt is sent to a locally deployed **SQLCoder-7B (GGUF)** model, which generates the SQL query. The decoding strategy uses **beam search** to enhance syntactic accuracy.
4. **Validation and Execution**: The generated SQL undergoes a final check for syntactic validity and is then executed against a live **SQLite** database to confirm it runs without errors and produces a valid result.
